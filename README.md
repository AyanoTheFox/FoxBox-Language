# How it works?
 is just say than a var is equal a valid value type, see the exemple:

```
numb = int: 1
decimal = float: 2
negative = signed int: -1
positiveDecimal = unsigned float: 2.4
boolean1 = bool: true; boolean2 = bool: 0
string = str: 'hello world'
character = char: "a"
expression = floor: 1 + 2.2
var name = int: 3
```

 it create globals vars
